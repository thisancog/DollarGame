# DollarGame

A very simple example of the Dollar Game as seen on the [Numberphile YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ).

You can play it online [here](https://thisancog.github.io/DollarGame/).

### Objectives
Distribute the numbers from the nodes to their connected nodes by clicking them in order to eliminate all negative values. Each click will add 1 to each connected node while subtracting the total of the node itself. You can move nodes around by dragging them.

### Notes

It still crashes from time to time, i.e. for a large number of nodes and/or edges. I try to fix this later.
