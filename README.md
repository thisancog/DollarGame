# DollarGame

A very simple example of the Dollar Game as seen on the [Numberphile YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ).

You can play it online [here](https://thisancog.github.io/DollarGame/).

### Objectives
Distribute the numbers from the nodes to their connected nodes by clicking them in order to eliminate all negative values. Each click will add 1 to each connected node while subtracting the total of the node itself.
